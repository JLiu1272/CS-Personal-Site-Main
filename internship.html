              <p><strong>Position:</strong> Backend Software Engineer Intern</p>
		      <p>Who is Tencent: Tencent is the company that built WeChat Message Service, WeChat Pay, QQ (A Social Media platform in China), QQ Music (Similar to Spotify), Tencent Video Streaming Platform similar to Netflix, and games like League of Legend, PUBG</p>
              <p>While I was there, I worked as a Backend Software Engineer. I contributed to their auto-pay feature on the WeChat Pay Hong Kong Mobile application, which they called the 代扣 Project. This feature allows users in Hong Kong to set up automatic payment with various vendors like HK Electric (Paying for electricity), paying for phone bills (ie. CMHK, SmartTone etc..), HKT (Most used ISP service in Hong Kong). Due to confidentiality, I may not share more details about this project. However, the technologies that I used was C++, which was the primary language for their backend infrastructure, and Python for unit testing.</p>

		      <h2>Octopus Limited Hong Kong - 2018 Summer</h2>
		      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Embedded Software Engineer Intern</p>
		      <p>I had the opportunity to work for Octopus Limited last summer. I was placed on their front-end team, which was the team that maintains and makes the hardware and software for RFID/NFC payment transaction on various vendor locations. The vendor locations include Subways, boutique shops, 7-11 etc...</p>
		      <strong> Project 1: "全城Wi-Fi" (Translated: Wi-Fi All Across Hong Kong")</strong>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>Project Proposal: Allow citizens to use Wi-Fi on the bus. This is done by enabling a dual function on the payment hardware (which is available on all buses in Hong Kong). The hardware should have to ability to emmit Wi-Fi signals, in addition to receiving payment from RFID cards.</li>
		      	<li>I worked on writing scripts to stress test the Wi-Fi signal. The stress test criteria included; Wi-Fi works for prolong period, Wi-Fi speed is adequate even when multiple devices are using it simultaneously.</li>
		      	<li>A script was written to simulate the worse possible environment that the Wi-Fi device may encounter. The script then prints out a report determining whether the test passed the stress test or not. If it fails, it indicates where specifically did it fail.</li>
		      	<li><strong>Technologies Used: </strong>Bash, Busybox (The swiss-knife of embedded systems)</li>
		      </ul>
		      <strong>Project 2: Octopus I-Pad Integration </strong>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>Worked on the client-server architecture, which allows an I-Pad to communicate with the hardware. It dynamically searches for the correct IP address for the device to connect to.</li>
		      	<li>This application was developed using Java, TCP/IP Protocol (aka socket) to communicate with hardware, and threading concepts to receive real time messages sent from card reader to be displayed on android application.</li>

		      <p><strong>Project 3:</strong> Made updates to their internal software written in C. The internal software is used to show byte allocations on the RFID card.</p>

		      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Embedded Software Engineer Intern.</p>
		      <p><strong>Project 1:</strong> Developed the entire website for managing internal hardware stocks using AngularJS, Flask, and Active Directory</p>
		      <p><strong>Project 2:</strong> Wrote scripts to purge logs older than a certain date on embedded systems using Bash</p>
		      <p><strong>Project 3:</strong> Wrote scripts to stress test hardware device using Python</p>
		      <p><strong>Project 4:</strong> Wrote a program in C to enable byte communication between Varacite board and STM32 using I2C</p>
		      <p><strong>Project 5:</strong> Wrote a python program that sends a signal to their custom built hardware indicating hardware is ready for processing</p>

		      <strong>Project 1: Object Storage's advantage over Block Storage</strong>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>I worked on investigating the advantages of Object Storage over Block Storage</li>
		      	<li>I looked at 2 different ways to implement Object Storage: Ceph vs. Swift</li>
		      	<li>I wrote a Java and Node.js program demonstrating the advantages of using Object Storage in the File System level</li>
		      	<li>The demonstration shows that Object storage is able to manage unstructured data (documents, music, videos) more effectively.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <strong>Project 2: Integrating Reddis with Flask</strong>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>I was asked to integrate Reddis with Flask. However, at the time, Flask did not have the Redis setting that we wanted. Therefore, a colleage and I worked together to allow this Reddis setting to operate properly with Flask</li>
		      </ul>
		      <strong>Project 3: Data Analytics with Splunk</strong>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>We used Splunk to monitor servers. (i.e server usage frequency, CPU usage, time the server is most frequently used etc..). The logging tool also showed reasons for server outage.</li>
