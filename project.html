	<!-- GPS Classifier -->
	<div id="GPS_Classifier">
		<h2>Using Data Mining Techniques to predict when car stops, and turns</h2>
		<p>We were given a set of GPS data, and were asked to predict when a car
		   stopped due to a stop sign or traffic light, and when a car turned left or right. Additionally, the GPS data was made of many paths, to eliminate the clutters, K-Means was used to agglomerate paths and remove issues related to dilution of precision.</p>
		<p><strong>Methods Used:</strong> DBScan, K-Means, Decision Tree Metholodigies</p>
		<p><strong>Teammates:</strong> Joe Golden, Niccolo Dehicchio</p>

	<!-- Recipe Replacement --> 
	<div id="Recipe_Replacement">
		<h2>Using Word Embedding to automate Recipe Replacement</h2>
		<p>In this project, we explore the possibility of creating a model that can identify replacement for an ingredient. For instance, if the query was butter, it should discover that margarine is similar to butter, so that is 1 potential replacement. The applications for this are numerous: along with aiding individuals with allergies and dietary restrictions, this can also help cooks understand how to use ingredients they already have. The idea is to transform ingredients into embeddings. With ingredients represented as embeddings, cosine similarity can be used to find the closest replacement.

		<h2>Predicting language of text (Dutch/English) using Decision Tree and Adaboost</h2>
		<p>I chose 8 features when making the the Decision Tree. The features used are detailed
		in the paper. The decision tree is also written from scratch (i.e does not use sci-kit learn). The classifier has a 99% accuracy. Details about the training and testing data are available in the paper</p>

		<h2>Implementation of Fundamental Data Mining Concepts from Scratch</h2>
		<h3>Concepts implemented include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Agglomeration (Agglomerated locations on a map)</li>
			<li>Otsu's Method (Used method to find best car speed when considering whether someone is speeding or not)</li>
			<li>PCA (Projected 120 dimension data onto 3 dimension)</li>
			<li>KNN (Used KNN to classify differnt types of shoppers at a grocery store)</li>
			<li>K-Means (performed k-means on carefully constructed data)</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>All implementations are compiled in this github link: </strong>

		<p>First, we agglomerated the data points. Then, we used PCA to project 120 Dimensional data to 3D data point. After projecting it, we were able to visualise it as a 3D plot</p>

	<h2>Prototyped a E-Wallet System for Octopus (A company based in HK)</h2>
	<p>
		In Hong Kong, Octopus is a major means of payment for many of us, especially on a subway. Octopus is considered a FinTech company in Hong Kong. In was originated to allow consumers to pay using an RFID based card. This payment is available in many different places such as grocery stores, subway etcâ€¦
	</p>	 
	<p>
		I created a prototype version demonstrating how Octopus can be transformed from being a RFID to a NFC based card. In other words, transforming Octopus to be an E-Wallet system. However, I did not realize that they had already built something similar and far better than what I could envision. Despite my lack of research on this matter, they were kind enough to invite me to their headquarter for a visit and taught me a lot about their design and factors they had to consider while building such an e-wallet system.
	</p>
	<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>NFC/RFID Adafruit Shield</li>
		<li>Arduino Board</li>
		<li>Android Development (Java)</li>
		<li>Flask for API</li>
		<li>SQL for DB</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> SMIF (Smart Meals Intelligent Fridge) </h2>
	<p>Teammates: Harshvardhan Gupta, Kyaw Khant Nyar, Robert Aguilera, Christine Van, Candy Wang</p>
	<p> 1st Prototype has been completed. </p>
	<p>
		Created an IOT device that will address 2 problems (Wasting food and Eating Unhealthy). We called it SMIF. It stands for Smart Meals, Intelligent Fridge.
		<br/><br/> 
		It does several things:
		<ol>
			<li>Keeps track of what you eat</li>
			<li>It gives you information about the food in your fridge (i.e Calories/Serving, Fat)</li>
			<li>It suggests recipe based on what is available on your fridge</li>
			<li>It notifies you when food when food is about to go bad.</li>
		</ol>
