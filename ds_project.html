			<h2>Jigsaw Puzzle Solver Using Computer Vision (2019)</h2>
			<p>In this project, we were provided with 198 images of puzzle pieces. 
			Our goal is to identify the type of puzzle piece it is by finding the corners, and 
			whether there is a puzzle piece in the image or not, and drawing the bounding box around
			the puzzle piece. Using these information, we can then attempt to solve the puzzle. The code 
			was written in Matlab.

		<!-- Recipe Replacement -->
		<div id="Recipe_Replacement">
			<h2>Using Word Embedding to automate Recipe Replacement (2018)</h2>
			<p>In this project, we explore the possibility of creating a model that can identify replacement for an ingredient. For instance, if the query was butter, it should discover that margarine is similar to butter, so that is 1 potential replacement. The applications for this are numerous: along with aiding individuals with allergies and dietary restrictions, this can also help cooks understand how to use ingredients they already have. The idea is to transform ingredients into embeddings. With ingredients represented as embeddings, cosine similarity can be used to find the closest replacement.

		<!-- Word Sense Disambiguation -->
		<div id="Word_Sense_Disambiguation">
			<h2>Word Sense Disambiguation using Decision List</h2>
			<p>The program determines the sense of a word based on context using Decision List proposed by David Yarowsky. The implementation was based on this paper <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P94-1013">Decision Lists for Lexical Ambiguity Resolution</a>. In this paper, the author used WSD method to differentiate between two different types of accent. We apply this same method to predict the sense of words. (BASS vs. SAKE)</a></p>
			<p>Currently, the implementation is only capable of determining two word sense (BASS and SAKE). The dataset used for training this decision list is obtained from R.Sproat textbook.</p>
			<strong>How does Decision List work ?</strong>
			<p>We create multiple collocation types based on data. Collocation types used are the window size, the Part of Speech tag of a word, and single words. Using these collocations, multiple if statements are created. The order in which the if statement is traversed is based on the Log-Likelihood of the Decision List. When given a new sentence that contains either a "Bass" or "Sake", it traverses through the if-statements in the sorted order, and returns the result of the if statement. If no match is found, it returns the majority rule. For the word "Bass", there were more sentences that had the musical meaning in the training data. Therefore, if no "if-statements" match, it would default to have the "musical" sense.</p>
			<strong>Log Likelihood Equation</strong>
			<img src="images/photos/wsd/log_likelihood.png" width="50%" height="50%">
			<p>Here is an example. If we were given the sentence, "Stephan Weidner, the composer and bass player for Boehse Onkelz, a", a window size of 2 collocation will generate a list like this; [2_window_composer, 2_window_and, 2_window_player, 2_window_for]. A collocation using Part of Speech tag will replace the respective word with the part of speech of the word based on its context. For example, it may generate a rule like this; -2_tag_noun because composer is a noun, and composer is 2 words left of "bass". A collocation using single words will only consider the word that is n words away from bass. For example, if we are creating a collocation using 2 words to the left, it will only consider composer. Hence, it will generate a rule like this; -2_word_composer.
			<br/>
			<strong>Summary of Collocations considered</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Word immediately to the right (+1 W)</li>
				<li>Word immediately to the left (-1 W)</li>
				<li>Word found in (+/- 5) word window (+/)</li>
				<li>Part of Speech Tag of word to the right (Tag + 1 W)</li>
				<li>Part of Speech Tag of word to the left (Tag -1 W)</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Decision made during Cleaning Corpus:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Removed punctuations</li>
				<li>I noticed that there were some xml tags such as <Doc=XXX>. I decided to remove those</li>
				<li>I also removed the dashes in compound words such as 7-pound and concatenated these 2 words together. Resulting in 7pound.</li>

			<h2>Finding shortest route for Marathon Runners using A* (2018)</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this program is to find the shortest route from a start point to a final point defined by the user. However, the runner must pass certain points along the path in order to get to its final destination. In addition, the elevation, and terrain type must be considered when finding the shortest path. The terrain and its ability to impede a runner may change depending on the season. Details about how the heuristic for the A* is outlined in the "Link to paper" section.</p>
