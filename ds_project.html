	<!-- GPS Classifier -->
	<div id="GPS_Classifier">
		<h2>Using Data Mining Techniques to predict when car stops, and turns</h2>
		<p>We were given a set of GPS data, and were asked to predict when a car
		   stopped due to a stop sign or traffic light, and when a car turned left or right. Additionally, the GPS data was made of many paths, to eliminate the clutters, K-Means was used to agglomerate paths and remove issues related to dilution of precision.</p>
		<p><strong>Methods Used:</strong> DBScan, K-Means, Decision Tree</p>
		<p><strong>Teammates:</strong> Joe Golden, Niccolo Dehicchio</p>

	<!-- Recipe Replacement --> 
	<div id="Recipe_Replacement">
		<h2>Using Word Embedding to automate Recipe Replacement</h2>
		<p>In this project, we explore the possibility of creating a model that can identify replacement for an ingredient. For instance, if the query was butter, it should discover that margarine is similar to butter, so that is 1 potential replacement. The applications for this are numerous: along with aiding individuals with allergies and dietary restrictions, this can also help cooks understand how to use ingredients they already have. The idea is to transform ingredients into embeddings. With ingredients represented as embeddings, cosine similarity can be used to find the closest replacement.

		<h2>Predicting language of text (Dutch/English) using Decision Tree and Adaboost</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this program is to determine whether the sentence is Dutch of English using Decision Tree and Adaboost.</p>
		<strong>Features Summary:</strong><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Does it contain English/Dutch stop words?</li>
			<li>Most common letter combinations in English/Dutch</li>
			<li>Does it contain an English/Dutch suffix?</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Testing and Training Sample Details</strong><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>For the training samples, there are 1610, 15 word , sentences scraped through various sources</li>
			<li>713 of the training sample is Dutch, and 897 of them were English sentences</li>
			<li>For the testing samples, there were 404, 15 word sentences</li>
			<li>179 of them were Dutch sentences, and 255 were English sentences</li>

	<!-- A* Path Planning -->
	<div id="PathPlanning">
		<h2>Finding shortest route for Marathon Runners using A*</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this program is to find the shortest route from a start point to a final point defined by the user. However, the runner must pass certain points along the path in order to get to its final destination. In addition, the elevation, and terrain type must be considered when finding the shortest path. The terrain and its ability to impede a runner may change depending on the season. Details about how the heuristic for the A* is outlined in the "Link to paper" section.</p>

		<p><strong>Figures:</strong> The path found is shown in red, and the blue points along the red paths are representative of the "must pass" points.</p>

		<h2>Implementation of Fundamental Data Mining Concepts from Scratch</h2>
		<h3>Concepts implemented include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Agglomeration (Agglomerated locations on a map)</li>
			<li>Otsu's Method (Used method to find best car speed when considering whether someone is speeding or not)</li>
			<li>PCA (Projected 120 dimension data onto 3 dimension)</li>
			<li>KNN (Used KNN to classify different types of shoppers at a grocery store)</li>
			<li>K-Means (performed k-means on carefully constructed data)</li>

		<p>First, we agglomerated the data points. Then, we used PCA to project 120 Dimensional data to 3 Dimension. After projecting it, we were able to visualise it as a 3D plot</p>
